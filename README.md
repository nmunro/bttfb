## (A git tutorial)

# Introduction

This tutorial on learning git is designed to be a little bit different from your average git tutorial, instead of saying what it is, I want to be clear what it is not:

- It will not be a comprehensive tutorial on everything you can do with git, if you wish to learn something specific; [RFTM](https://git-scm.com/doc).
- It will require that you _read_ and _understand_ what is going on, if you copy and paste mindlessly, that's on you, you'll only be cheating yourself out of learning something.

Like many things in the computer science/programming world this resource can only take you so far. You, dear reader, owe it to yourself to continue your learning beyond the limitations of this tutorial,
