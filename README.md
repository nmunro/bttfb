## (A git tutorial)

# Introduction

I used to teach in a bootcamp.

I rather enjoyed it, until I didn't.

One thing that stuck with me though is students would begin learning through the first two weeks, learning html, css, and a tiny bit of JavaScript, and then we would move to the third week, collaborative development. Almost all students, without fail, hit a cognative brick wall.

And that wall had a name; Git.

I often found students asking "is it like x", "oh so you mean it's like y?" and none of them were right, they were simply attempting to apply existing knowledge to a new problem domain, which is generally a logcal approach, but most students didn't have anything to relate it to, until one uneventful Tuesday it occured to me and I said it outloud: "No, it's not like any of those, but... you know what, it's like 'Back To The Future'".

Two things happened immediately.

About half the class had a moment of epiphany and realised what I was trying to get at, the other half of the class asked "What's 'Back To The Future?'"

You, dear reader, will receive the same homework they did, go and watch the trilogy, right now, no seriously. Go, I'll wait!
