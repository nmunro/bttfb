## Lesson

Throughout this and the next lessons we will be using git in a creative retelling of the Back To The Future story.

For the uninitiated, in the story of Back To The Future, the protagonist (Marty McFly) finds himself accidentally transported from 1985 to 1955 and triggers what is known as the "Grandfather Paradox". A type of temporal complication known as an "Infinite Regression Paradox". A paradox is a contradictory statement that appears to remain true, despite its contradictions.

An example might be: "That sucks worse than a broken vacuum cleaner", well a broken vacuum cleaner doesn't suck, so as a vacuum it sucks, which means it doesn't suck, which means it sucks, etc

The grandfather paradox is similar: You go back in time to kill your grandfather, so you were never born, and if you were never born, you never went back and so your grandfather is alive, which means you were born, which means you go back, which means you were etc.

Before we get to the end of Act I, however, we must fill in some details (and do things with git), so it's time to get started.

    $ mkdir bttf
    $ cd bttf
    $ git init
