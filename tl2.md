(Before anyone comes to investigate the crash of the Libyans' van into the Fox Photo stand, Doc drives his truck away from Lone Pine Mall, taking Marty to Courthouse Square for him to retrieve the DeLorean from the Assembly of Christ building before any witnesses arrive downtown.

He is carrying a note Marty has handed him in lieu of verbal information about his own future, but is hesitant about reading it. While he has torn it up, he does not discard it. Doc must wait almost three decades before acquiring the technology required to build the device he has just seen with his own eyes, and is careful enough not to further interfere with McFly family events as they unfold over the next decades, although the McFly family is more affluent as a result of George being more assertive over the next 30 years. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 12 | 2204 | Lightning strikes the Hill Valley Courthouse, sending Marty in the DeLorean back to 1985 via a complex utilization of the energy of the lightning strike itself devised by Doc Brown, and thanks to Marty’s precise foreknowledge of this local historic event.

| 1955 | Saturday, November 12 | 2157 | A gust of wind blows down a tree branch, snapping the lightning cable. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 12 | 2128 | As Marvin's injured hand prevents him from playing guitar, Marty subs up for him on stage. While George and Lorraine are finally beginning to enjoy themselves at the dance, Dixon cuts in. George nevertheless takes what is rightly his and the future Mr. and Mrs. McFly finally share their first kiss. The timeline in which George's and Lorraine's three children were never born has been averted, as Marty observes from his photo. Marvin asks if Marty would like to do one more number, and he plays "Johnny B. Goode" (leading Marvin to phone his cousin Chuck about "that new sound you've [Chuck] been looking for"). Before parting with his young future parents, Marty offers them additional advice in order to assure he will have a nice life back in 1985. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 12 | 2100 | Marty borrows Doc’s car to take Lorraine to the dance, but Biff steals her away. As 3-D, Match and Skinhead lock Marty inside the trunk of Reginald's car, they have a brief altercation with the band. Given the keys fell inside the trunk, Marvin is forced to use a screwdriver to open it, cutting his hand in the process. George arrives while Marty is suddenly absent. George punches Biff before he has his way with Lorraine, but she hasn’t fallen for him quite yet. George and Marty have more to do before Marty’s future is restored, and Marty’s photo proves it. Marty himself begins to be "erased from existence." |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 12 | Afternoon | Marty observes that Dave, and then Linda, have disappeared from his photograph from the future, indicating that the current timeline has already changed into a timeline in which they will never be born. He looks noticeably concerned. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 12 | Afternoon | Biff picks up his car from Western Auto, and is billed $302.57 — much to his shock. After an argument with Terry the mechanic, Biff approaches Lorraine, who, accompanied by Babs, has just picked up her dress for the dance from Ruth's Frock Shop (near Western Auto). As he boasts to her that he will marry her someday, she rebuffs his advances: "I wouldn’t be your girl even if you had a million dollars". Biff then jumps into his car to drive home and get ready for the evening. There is nobody with him. |
| 1955 | Wednesday, November 9 | Unknown | George and Marty come up with a plan for Saturday night that will see George become a "fighter" for Lorraine Baines. |
| 1955 | Tuesday, November 8 | Unknown | After fitting the DeLorean with a detachable pole and hook (directed into the flux capacitor when attached), Doc uses a model of the town — plus a wind-up toy car and a live electric cable — to demonstrate to Marty the plan on getting him back to the future. Immediately after, Lorraine arrives, having followed Marty, asking him to take her to the dance, much to Marty's empathy. |
| 1955 | Tuesday, November 8 | Unknown | George reports his weird alien experience to "Calvin," telling him that Darth Vader said he would melt his brain if he failed to ask out Lorraine. After George helps Marty open a Pepsi bottle, they go into the cafe, where George talks with Lorraine. The plan is successful at first, until Biff and his gang interfere. Biff and his gang chase Marty around Courthouse Square, and Marty improvises a skateboard to escape. Lorraine ignores George in favor of Marty. Biff’s car has its first recorded encounter with a manure truck. |
| 1955 | Tuesday, November 8 | 0121 | Marty, in a radiation suit as "Darth Vader from the planet "Vulcan", visits George to try and make him take Lorraine to the dance that Saturday. |

| 1955 | Sunday, November 6 | Unknown | Doc learns that Marty has interfered with his parents' first meeting and that he and his siblings will be “erased from existence” unless Marty can get his parents together. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 5 | Unknown | After Doc tells Marty that only "a bolt of lightning" could provide the power to make the time machine function, Marty shows him the flyer with the details of the clock tower lightning strike (which he got in 1985). The two then devise a plan to channel the lightning exactly one week from this date. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 5 | Unknown | Marty finds the young Doc Brown and shows him the time machine from thirty years in Doc’s future. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 5 | Unknown | Marty pushes George out of the way of Sam Baines's car and gets knocked unconscious, thus interfering with George's first meeting with Lorraine Baines. After a 9-hour sleep, Marty wakes up in Lorraine's care. She then invites him to dinner with her family. Just as they are about to offer Marty a night's stay, he suddenly runs off, leaving Lorraine's mom Stella to regard him as a "strange young man", and her dad Sam threatening to disown Lorraine if she ever has a kid acting like him. |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 5 | 0829 | Marty arrives in downtown Hill Valley, and steps into Lou's Cafe, where he meets George McFly. Biff Tannen and his gang enter shortly afterwards. As they pick on George, Marty directly witnesses his future father's inability to stand up to them, even as Biff warns George not to come back into the cafe. Goldie Wilson gives George advice on standing up for himself, but George ignores it, even as Marty hints about Goldie running for Mayor (which inspires Goldie to go for it, much to the amusement of his boss, the cafe's owner Lou Carruthers). |
| 1955 | Saturday, November 5 | 0615 | Marty McFly arrives in 1955, on Old Man Peabody's farm, and knocks down one of Otis Peabody's twin pine trees. After fleeing from an angry Old Man Peabody, Marty drives over to Lyon Estates, only to discover it under construction.
